        <h1>The Pussycat Dolls</h1>
      </div>

      <div class="maingrouptext">
        <p>
          The Pussycat Dolls were an American girl group and dance ensemble,
          founded in Los Angeles, California, by choreographer Robin Antin in
          1995 as a burlesque troupe. At the suggestion of Jimmy Iovine, Antin
          decided to take the burlesque troupe mainstream as a pop group. Antin
          negotiated a record deal with Interscope Geffen A&M Records in 2003
          turning the group into a music franchise comprising Nicole
          Scherzinger, Carmit Bachar, Ashley Roberts, Jessica Sutta, Melody
          Thornton, and Kimberly Wyatt. Their debut single, "Sway", was featured
          on the soundtrack of the 2004 film Shall We Dance?. The Pussycat Dolls
          achieved worldwide success with the singles "Don't Cha", "Stickwitu",
          "Buttons", and their multi-platinum debut album PCD (2005). However,
          despite their commercial success, the group was plagued by internal
          conflict due to the emphasis on Scherzinger, the group's lead
          vocalist, and the subordinate treatment of the other members. Bachar's
          departure from the group preceded the release of their second and
          final studio album Doll Domination (2008), which contains hit singles
          "When I Grow Up", "I Hate This Part", and "Jai Ho! (You Are My
          Destiny)". Following the completion of their 2009 world tour, the
          group went on hiatus and fully disbanded in 2010. The original
          recording line-up, minus Thornton, announced their reunion in 2019
          with an upcoming tour and a new album. However, with the worsening
          situation arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, along with breaches of
          contracts and logistical issues, the reunion tour was cancelled in
          2022, leaving the group's fate uncertain. The Pussycat Dolls brand
          diversified into merchandise, reality television programs, a Las Vegas
          act, product endorsements, spin-off recording groups (Girlicious,
          Paradiso Girls, G.R.L.), and other ventures. Billboard ranked the
          Pussycat Dolls as the 80th most successful musical act of the 2000s.
          The group has sold 55 million records worldwide, making them one of
          the best-selling girl groups of all time. In 2012, the Pussycat Dolls
          ranked 100th on VH1's 100 Greatest Women in Music, and as the tenth
          all-girl group.

      </div>

        <p>
          Antin began exploring the idea of a modern burlesque troupe during
          1990 with Carla Kama and Christina Applegate as performers. The troupe
          began to perform in 1995, with a repertoire of 1950s and 1960s popular
          music standards while dressed in lingerie or old-fashioned pin-up
          costumes. They secured a Thursday night residency at a Los Angeles
          nightclub, The Viper Room, where they stayed from 1995 to 2001. They
          appeared briefly in the 1998 films Matters of Consequence (dancing to
          Henry Mancini's "Hub Caps and Tail Lights", and Keely Smith's "When
          Your Lover has Gone"), and The Treat (directed by Jonathan Gems). From
          1995 to 2003 there were numerous guest vocalists, and many changes to
          the dance personnel. The troupe received wider press coverage during
          June 1999, when Playboy featured a Pussycat Dolls pictorial, featuring
          at least seven contemporary members posing semi-nude (Kasey Campbell,
          Kiva Dawson, Antonietta Macri, Erica Breckels, Katie Bergold, Erica
          Gudis and Lindsley Allen). Three years later, the Pussycat Dolls moved
          to The Roxy Theatre in West Hollywood. They were featured in
          magazines, television specials for MTV and VH1, ad campaigns, and
          films. Some of the Pussycat Dolls appeared in the 2003 film Charlie's
          Angels: Full Throttle, dancing to Mancini's "The Pink Panther Theme".
          They were also featured in Pink's "Trouble" music video. Along with
          Applegate, Christina Aguilera and Carmen Electra (who was the group's
          lead performer for many of their shows) the troupe was featured in a
          Maxim magazine shoot in 2002, which increased public interest in them
          (Aguilera later appeared in the similarly themed 2010 film Burlesque
          directed by Robin Antin's brother Steve). Following their growing
          popularity, Interscope Geffen A&M Records music producers Jimmy Iovine
          and Ron Fair became involved with the group helping them to transform
          into a franchise after Gwen Stefani was asked to perform with the
          group. The former dance troupe evolved into a popular music recording
          group and became employees of Iovine's label Interscope Records. The
          only troupe members who remained after the re-casting process were
          Robin Antin, Carmit Bachar, Cyia Batten, Kasey Campbell, Ashley
          Roberts, Jessica Sutta and Kimberly Wyatt. Electra, when asked about
          her lack of involvement with the group's evolution into a popular
          music group, said, "I was part of [the Pussycat Dolls] for over two
          years and did every show with them but financially, I couldn't become
          part of their new music project. It was a sacrifice I couldn't make."

          During 2003, Antin struck a joint venture with Interscope Records to
          develop the Pussycat Dolls into a brand, with Jimmy Iovine assigning
          the project to Ron Fair. Auditions followed suit, for a separate group
          which would not include celebrity members. Singers Nicole Scherzinger,
          Melody Thornton and Kaya Jones were recruited, joining Bachar,
          Roberts, Sutta, Wyatt, Batten, Campbell and Antin to form a new
          recording group. In February 2004, they performed "Big Spender" live
          at the MTV Asia Awards. In 2004, they recorded "We Went as Far as We
          Felt Like Going" for the Shark Tale soundtrack and recorded the
          single, "Sway" which is featured on the soundtrack of Shall We Dance?
          The group briefly reunited with Electra for a guest performance at VH1
          Divas 2004 where they performed "Tainted Love", "You Can Leave Your
          Hat On" (with Tom Jones) and "Girls on Film" before joining the
          headliners in a finale of "New Attitude" alongside Patti LaBelle. Kaya
          Jones left the group in September 2004, while Batten and Campbell left
          in January 2005. Antin would eventually shift into a strictly
          managerial and creative role. The group's debut album, PCD, was
          released in September 2005 and sold three million copies in the United
          States. The album's lead single, "Don't Cha", was a number-one hit in
          various countries worldwide, and reaching number two on the US
          Billboard Hot 100. It was followed by "Stickwitu", which became their
          second number-one single in the UK and New Zealand, and reached number
          five on the Hot 100. It was nominated for the Grammy Award for Best
          Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. "Beep" also became a
          hit, reaching number one in Belgium and New Zealand, number two in the
          UK, and number thirteen in the US. The group became one of the
          top-selling artists in 2006, while the album appeared at number twelve
          on the Billboard 200-year-end chart that year. The group was selected
          to perform for the introduction for ABC's coverage of the NBA. The
          Pussycat Dolls first opened for The Black Eyed Peas' Honda Civic Tour
          in North America.[32] To further promote the album, Snoop Dogg was
          added to a remix of "Buttons", which became a worldwide hit reaching
          number three on the Billboard Hot 100, and top five elsewhere. The
          Pussycat Dolls embarked on their PCD World Tour with Rihanna as the
          opening act in the UK leg. One of the dates of the PCD World Tour was
          recorded and streamed via MSN Music. The group ran into trouble in
          Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia with the authorities for sexually explicit
          dancing. The performance, a part of the PCD World Tour, was not well
          received in the Muslim state, which frowned upon the group's
          "eye-popping attire" and "sexually suggestive stage routines".
          Absolute Entertainment, the company behind the group's appearance in
          Malaysia, was fined $3000 for the incident. Two final singles would be
          released from the album, "I Don't Need a Man" and "Wait a Minute",
          with the former becoming a moderate success and the latter becoming
          the group's fifth top 40 single on the Hot 100. To further promote
          PCD, the Pussycat Dolls toured along with Danity Kane on Christina
          Aguilera's Back to Basics Tour in North America from February to May
          2007. The success of the group's debut album brought them a wide array
          of spin-offs including a CW reality series, Pussycat Dolls Present:
          The Search for the Next Doll. The goal of the show was to add a
          seventh member to join them in future endeavors. Asia Nitollano was
          announced as the winner on April 24, however several months later, it
          was revealed that Nitollano had actually quit the group shortly after
          the finale aired. Following their performance at Live Earth, the group
          would only have occasional one-off performances for a while and went
          on a hiatus in mid-2007, during which Scherzinger attempted to launch
          a solo career. Plans for her debut solo album, Her Name is Nicole,
          would eventually be shelved after the release of four singles failed
          to make an impact on the charts. In August 2007, Sutta would be
          featured on the Paul van Dyke track "White Lies", which topped the US
          Billboard Hot Dance Singles chart.

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          On March 3, 2008, it was announced via the group's website that Carmit
          Bachar had left the group, intending to pursue a solo career. At the
          time of her departure, she had been the longest performing member of
          the group, joining in 1995 when they were a burlesque act. Several
          days later, they performed for the first time without Bachar for the
          Operation MySpace concert which honored US troops stationed in Kuwait.
          In May 2008, they released their second album's lead single "When I
          Grow Up", which reached the top ten in 16 countries. At the 2008 MTV
          Video Music Awards, its accompanying music video was nominated for six
          awards, the most of that ceremony and went on to win Best Dancing in a
          Video. Doll Domination was released in September 2008 to mixed
          reviews. It attained their highest peak position on the Billboard 200,
          but failed to match the sales of its predecessor, selling less than a
          sixth as many as PCD sold (in the UK), and regarding it as a
          commercial disappointment. Three subsequent singles were released in
          2008, "Whatcha Think About That", "Out of This Club", and "I Hate This
          Part"; the last one peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100
          chart. In January 2009, the Pussycat Dolls embarked on the Doll
          Domination Tour, their second headlining worldwide concert tour, which
          highlighted stops in Europe, Oceania, and Asia, and grossed over $14
          million. Between the first two legs, the group opened for The Circus
          Starring Britney Spears in North America. In May 2009, Jessica Sutta
          suffered a back injury during the first Sydney show, leaving the group
          performing as a foursome throughout the following shows. While on tour
          in Europe, Nicole Scherzinger was asked to re-write pop version of
          "Jai Ho" from the film Slumdog Millionaire (2008). The song was
          entitled "Jai Ho! (You Are My Destiny)" and credited Scherzinger as a
          featured artist. This caused internal strife within the group, and a
          public outburst by Melody Thornton during one of the group's
          appearances on tour. Despite that, it became one of their most
          successful singles, and peaked at number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100,
          after charging eighty-five places, making the largest weekly leap from
          number 100. The album's final two singles, "Bottle Pop" and "Hush
          Hush; Hush Hush" topped the US Hot Dance/Club Songs chart. Meanwhile,
          Doll Domination was reissued into scaled down versions in various
          territories; in Australia, the album was subtitled 2.0. with ten songs
          and an EP subtitled The Mini Collection was released in the United
          Kingdom. After the tour's conclusion, the group went on a hiatus, with
          Robin Antin acknowledging that new members would be joining
          Scherzinger. By February 2010, Jessica Sutta, Ashley Roberts, Kimberly
          Wyatt, and Melody Thornton had announced their departures from the
          group, with Wyatt later acknowledging that "the group has fully
          disbanded." In May 2010, four new members surrounded Scherzinger in a
          new line-up, but by the end of the year, Scherzinger had left the
          group to pursue a solo career. In 2011, there were continued attempts
          to rebuild the group, and a line-up that included former Paradiso
          Girls member Lauren Bennett, former Girlicious member Chrystina
          Sayers, Paula van Oppen, Vanessa Curry, and Dallas Cowboys
          Cheerleaders Erica Kiehl Jenkins was featured in a GoDaddy commercial
          during Super Bowl XLVI. The group would go on to call themselves
          G.R.L, citing the need for differentiating from the Pussycat Dolls due
          to their music being less urban and they would spend the rest of the
          year recording their debut album. In 2015, the group would disband
          nine months after member Simone Battle committed suicide following a
          battle with depression, before returning as a trio in 2016.

          After the group's initial disbandment in 2010, all members continued
          on their solo projects. Carmit Bachar would join musician Sammy Jay to
          become electronic music duo LadyStation, releasing the extended play
          Voices in 2015. She would later release her first solo single in 2017,
          "It's Time". In 2010, Kimberly Wyatt joined a musical duo called Her
          Majesty & the Wolves and released their debut album on July 11, 2011.
          That same year, she was featured on the Aggro Santos song "Candy"
          which became a UK top five hit. In June 2011, Melody Thornton
          announced plans to have her debut studio album released sometime in
          2012. On March 15, 2012, she released her first mixtape, "P.O.Y.B.L",
          and contains ten tracks of five remakes and four originals all written
          by Thornton. On June 3, 2011, Jessica Sutta announced that she had
          signed to Hollywood Records and her first single, "Show Me", peaked at
          number one on the Hot Dance Club Songs in the United States. However,
          her planned debut studio album Sutta Pop was shelved and she later
          left the label. Using the name J Sutta, she released the mixtape
          Feline Resurrection in 2016. Later, she released her debut studio
          album I Say Yes on March 3, 2017. On November 7, 2012, it was
          confirmed that Ashley Roberts would compete in the twelfth series of
          the British reality show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here! airing
          on ITV. In January 2013, Roberts became a member of the ice panel for
          the final two series of British skating show, Dancing on Ice on ITV.
          In June 2014, Roberts announced her debut album, titled Butterfly
          Effect, would be released on September 1, 2014. Lead member Nicole
          Scherzinger continued her solo career after a halt to release the
          group's second and final studio album. In March 2010, it was announced
          that Scherzinger would be a celebrity contestant on the tenth season
          of Dancing with the Stars, partnering with Derek Hough which she won.
          In March 2011, Scherzinger released her debut studio album, Killer
          Love, and experienced moderate success in certain territories. The
          album included second single, "Don't Hold Your Breath" which debuted
          atop the UK Singles Chart. The album's third single, "Right There",
          was remixed featuring 50 Cent and released as the lead single for the
          US version of Killer Love. It peaked at number thirty-nine on the
          Billboard Hot 100, and reached the top ten in countries such as
          Australia, Ireland, New Zealand, Romania, Scotland and the United
          Kingdom.[144] In May 2011, Scherzinger was hired as a judge on the
          first season of the American version of The X Factor, alongside Simon
          Cowell, Paula Abdul and L.A. Reid.[146] After her stint in the United
          States, Scherzinger joined The X Factor UK for its ninth series as the
          fourth permanent judge.[147] In May 2013, Scherzinger was confirmed as
          a returning judge for the tenth series of The X Factor UK. In January
          2014, it was reported that Scherzinger left Interscope Records and
          signed a multimillion-dollar recording deal with Sony Records.
          Scherzinger's album, titled Big Fat Lie, was released in October 2014.
